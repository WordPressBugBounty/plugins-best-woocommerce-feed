<h3>üß©Compact Features For Easy Feed Generation Without Extra Effortüß©</h3>

Feed generation for Google Shopping and Facebook Marketplace is one of our specialties.

But you will get more features to help you maximize business value out of the plugin, no matter which country you are from.

<h4>üåü Pre-built Product Feed Templates</h4>

You will get built-in feed templates for all supported online marketplaces.

This means you do not need to manually set up product data files. Simply choose the template and map the product data accordingly.

In as few as 3 clicks, you can get a usable product feed generated!

- Here are all the <a href="https://rextheme.com/best-woocommerce-product-feed/online-merchants/?utm_source=pfm_repo&utm_medium=merchants-landing-url&utm_campaign=pfm-repo-to-merchants-landing" target="_blank">180+ supported merchants</a> with pre-built feed templates in PFM.

<h4>üåü Custom Product Feeds For Any Merchants </h4>

Getting pre-made product feed templates is only one aspect of this product feed software.

You can do much more, such as adding extra product data, filtering selected products, creating feeds for merchants without existing templates, and even combining multiple data into a single attribute etc.

For unsupported merchants, you can modify an existing template or choose to create a Custom Feed, where you will be able to:

- Select your preferred feed attributes
- Choose the custom feed type (file type)
- Include/Exclude XML header
- Add Wrapper Element
- Add Item Wrapper

<h4>üåü Automated Product Feed Generation & Updates</h4>

Keeping your product data feed updated is important when you add new products, change details, adjust inventory, etc.

Most tools require you to update your feed files manually every time you make changes.

With PFM, you can automate the feed generation process with scheduled updates so that all changes reflect in your marketplace as well.

<h4>üåü Category Mapping</h4>

Google Shopping and several online marketplaces require you to set your products under a fixed Category List defined by Google. But changing your own store‚Äôs categories is not necessary.

Use our exclusive category mapping feature to define your products correctly under the right categories in the feed files (as required by your desired online marketplace).

Here's how it works:

- All your current categories will be listed.
- Beside them, you can define which Google Categories they should map to.
- Get auto-suggestions from Google Categories to avoid mishaps.
- Select the category and save.
- During feed generation, assign this to the category field.

So, no going back and forth to add the right categories.

For other online shops, you will have to do a little bit of copy & pasting (instead of choosing a Google category, define the Category from your desired merchant).

It's more convenient than changing your store's native categories and losing SERP rankings.

<h4>üåü Custom Filtering</h4>

You may need to generate a product feed with only a few sets of products based on category, attribute, etc. (Maybe you want to list on marketplaces with fixed product types, or you want to run special campaigns for these products only.

Here, the plugin comes with smooth filter options to include or exclude products from your product feed.

* Category filter
* Tag-based filter
* Price filter
* Custom filters based on any product attribute
* Filters based on Product Creation Date & Last Modified Date, etc.

You will stay in control of your campaigns and **spending in marketplaces (that charge for listings)**.

<h4>üåü 5 Product Feed File Types</h4>

Product feed manager supports different types of feed files:

- XML Product feed
- CSV Product feed
- TEXT Product feed
- TSV Product feed
- RSS Product feed

When selecting a merchant in the plugin, you will get the option to select the feed file type.

<em>For most merchants, we limit the choice based on what they allow. But for custom feeds, you have to choose the right one.</em>

<h4>üåü WooCommerce Custom Fields</h4>

WooCommerce has recently introduced new fields for Brand and GTIN. But some other fields are not included, such as UPC, MPN, age group, and gender.

These identifiers are often required for most online marketplaces (even on Google Shopping for certain typs of products).

With Product Feed Manager for WooCommerce, you will get a set of custom fields added to your products to represent these identifiers.

Simply input data per product and then generate the product feed with those values included.

No extra coding or additional plugins needed.

<h4>üåü WooCommerce Variable Product & Variation Options</h4>

If you have variable products in your WooCommerce store, you can decide how you want to include them in the feed.

- Include only the parent product data in the feed (no variations included).
- Generate each product variation as a separate product in the feed.
- Create a composite feed with both the parent product data and variation product data (handled with specific identifiers and feed structure).

<em>*You can also add the variation attributes to the product title.</em>

This WooCommerce product feed plugin is fully compatible with both Simple and Variable products.

<h4>üåü Combined Attributes & Feed Rules</h4>

You can merge multiple attributes into a single attribute value in your XML product feed.

<em>For example, in the product title, you can add a brand name after the product title to attract your targeted audience without manually changing it.</em>

This helps to rank your marketplace listings higher on search engines and trigger more clicks.

Also, you can define rules to generate custom product data, such as deducting a certain amount from the price, etc.

<h4>üåü Language Localization & RTL Support</h4>

PFM is optimized to serve in any country! You can translate the plugin for better use or your feed to reach consumers across global marketplaces.

<em>**Right-to-left (RTL) Language Support**</em>

For RTL languages such as Arabic or Hebrew, the plugin interface will automatically adjust to RTL layout.

<em>**Localization Support**</em>

You can easily use a translation plugin to localize the plugin language as per your needs.

<h5>‚û°Ô∏è WPML Support</h5>

While the plugin itself is translatable, you can use WPML to generate product feed in multiple languages.

In marketplaces such as Google Shopping, you can upload product feed for multiple regions and run local campaigns to get high conversions.
